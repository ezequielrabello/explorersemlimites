## 👨🏻‍💻 About the project

This was a project offered by RocketSeat.
It's based on simple HTML and CSS with the purpose of training your web-designing skills. On CSS, it was suggested to be creative and exercise CSS animation funcions. Therefore, we have the down arrow going from one side to the other and the same thing happening with the small planets.
